# **Hyper-Personalization & Recommendation System**

## **Overview**
This project is an **AI-powered Hyper-Personalization & Recommendation System** that provides **real-time, tailored financial recommendations** based on **customer profiles, financial behavior, transactions, and social sentiment analysis**. 

It leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Vector Databases** to generate highly personalized insights for users in banking and financial services.

---

## **Project Approach**
- **Data Collection**: Aggregates structured and unstructured financial data, including customer demographics, transaction history, credit utilization, and social sentiment.
- **Vector Database**: Uses **ChromaDB** to store and retrieve relevant embeddings efficiently.
- **Embedding Model**: Converts textual data into vector representations for **semantic search and similarity matching**.
- **LLM Integration**: Utilizes **Zephyr-7B-beta** to process user queries and generate personalized recommendations.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Retrieves relevant financial context before generating responses.
- **User Interface**: Built with **Streamlit** for an interactive and user-friendly experience.

- **Continuous Learning:** Integrates user feedback loops for iterative model improvement.

---

## **Hyperparameter Tuning**
- **Embedding Model:** Optimized **vector dimensionality (768/1024)** for better retrieval.
- **LLM Settings:**
  - `max_length=6000`, `max_new_tokens=500`
  - `bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=bfloat16` for memory-efficient inference.
- **Vector Retrieval:**
  - `k=3` to fetch the most relevant financial documents.
  - Implementing **reranking strategies** to improve response quality.

---

## **Ethical Considerations**
